        "Summary": "This is a photo editing application mostly built with Python libraries such as OpenCV, PIL Front built with Jinja is a web template engine. Features include Rotate, Crop Image, Image Effects, etc",
        "Lesson Learned": "I learnt a lot working with Python and using the OpenCV for image manipulation and Jinja for template rendering ",
        "Tech Stack": "Flask, Jinja2, Python, Heroku",
        "How to Run": "Visit the website",
        "Sample Login Details": "",
        "Project Purpose and Goal": "I built this project to enable me have my own personal photo editor. ",
        "Web Stack and Explanation": "Python was the choice I made to build this project based on the fact that the language already had excellent libraries for image manipulation such as opencv-python and Pillow. ",
        "Problems and Thought Process": "I started the project by making a breakdown of how I wanted the pages to be divided and what I wanted each page to contain. Then I did my research on using OpenCV and its limitations in relation to image manipulation and using filters. I also had to figure out had to create the resizable and draggable text components that would be added to the image. Simplicity,  quick responsiveness to user interactions and good UI were the most important components for me throughout the process",

        "Project Purpose and Goal": "The client wanted to create a website for their business. It was meant to be simple without the need to have an administration section",
        "Web Stack and Explanation": "I used React JS was used for the Frontend, Express.js for the backend and Mongoose for the database. I chose to use React because of its ease of use and its great state management when incorporated with Redux. Express.js and MongoDB were chosen due to their ease of usage, security and easy incorporation with the React Frontend",
        "Problems and Thought Process": "I started off using  Writemaps and Webflow  for sitemapping and wireframing. Since the format was straightforward, I didn't spend much time on the actual design before transferring it to code. The process from authentication to final checkout is very straightforward, and you don't even need to authenticate to be able to see the list of products. I made use of Next Js due to the benefit of SSR to help SEO and the fact I could write the  backend and frontend under one umbrella",
